# Game-engine-in-Python

A (very) crude game engine I made in Python as a learning experience when learning about the theory behind 3D games!

Currently, just for fun and a bit of experimenting, so it doesn't quite support the features that Unreal 5 might have just yet (as may become somewhat obvious when its run).
